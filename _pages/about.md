Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan Meppe and right now I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at an edtech startup called [Snappet](https://www.snappet.org/).

Before that I worked as a Data Scientist for a large [Fortune 200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500) company.

## I wrote some popular articles

Three popular articles that I wrote are (read >2k times)::

* [Regex For Noobs (like me!) - An Illustrated Guide]({% post_url 2019-08-04-regex-for-noobs %})
* [How to add a new kernel to your Jupyter Notebook]({% post_url 2020-08-20-how-to-add-new-kernel-in-jupyter-notebook %})
* [How to set Python 3 as default on Mac]({% post_url 2021-01-20-how-to-set-python3-as-default-mac %})

## I love data-driven decision making

I believe that machine learning is just one expression of **data-driven decision making**:

* I used data-driven decision making to become **one of the best 500 players in Europe** in a game called [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/) (that's the *0.0012%th percentile performance*)
* I used data-driven decision making to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube in **under 15 seconds**
* I used data-driven decision making to reduce a client's CI/CD build times **by a factor 3x** resulting in significant cost savings

## I write (a lot)

I write because I like it and because writing can help people at scale:

* [Janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/) hosts 50+ of my blog posts
* [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/) contains 100+ editions of my now discontinued daily newsletter
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) featured one of my blog posts on their front page and was read more than 30.000 times.



## I build mobile apps

I built an iPhone app that was live on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en) and wrote about what I learned:

* [View 3 good things: a gratitude log on the App store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en)
